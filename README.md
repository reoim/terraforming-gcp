# terraforming-gcp
Build an app just like [Terraformer](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer) from scratch.

This is a personal practice to get used to using golang and to have deeper understanding of Terraform and Google Cloud Platform.

I may copy&use and customise code from [Terraformer](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer) and [Terraforming](https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming) for study purposes only.
